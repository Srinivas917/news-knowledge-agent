    "Nvidia has confirmed the availability of its Drive AGX Thor developer kit for pre-order, designed to address the growing complexity of self-driving technology. The kit is built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, DriveOS 7 software, and Arm Neoverse V3AE CPUs, providing developers and researchers with a platform to accelerate the design, testing, and deployment of autonomous vehicles and intelligent mobility solutions. The Drive AGX Thor developer kit is purpose-built for reasoning vision language action models and comes with sufficient I/O to support cameras, radar, and lidar sensors. It is part of Nvidia's Drive Thor ecosystem, which has been adopted by several leading automakers and self-driving trucking companies. The kit is expected to meet the demand for powerful tools that can help satisfy automotive-grade safety requirements, as the rollout of autonomous vehicles gathers momentum.",
    "Helm.ai, a US-based start-up, has signed a multi-year joint development agreement with Honda to supply the Japanese automaker with its self-driving technology. The deal focuses on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems for Honda's mainstream cars and leverages Helm.ai's full-stack real-time AI software and large-scale autolabeling and generative simulation foundation models. Honda will have access to Helm.ai's suite of products, including perception stack, vision-based real-time path prediction AI, and generative simulation models. The partnership aims to accelerate the development of Honda's Navigate on Autopilot platform, which uses end-to-end AI for perception, decision making, and actuation. Mass production of the technology is targeted after 2027, with the goal of implementing it across a broader vehicle lineup and reducing traffic collision fatalities.",
    "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Nvidia have announced an expanded portfolio of AI factory offerings to accelerate enterprise AI adoption across industries. The partnership includes AI-ready RTX PRO servers, the new HPE Compute XD690 system, and enhanced Nvidia AI Computing Portfolio. HPE is also working with Accenture to test AI agent workflows and has added 26 new partners to its 'Unleash AI' program, bringing the total to over 70. The companies are focusing on security with HPE Private Cloud AI supporting air-gapped management, multi-tenancy capabilities, and post-quantum cryptography. Additionally, KDDI Corporation will implement Nvidia's AI infrastructure at its Osaka Sakai Data Center, leveraging the Nvidia GB200 NVL72 platform to accelerate AI adoption in the Asia-Pacific region.",
    "Nvidia has launched a series of next-generation agentic AI and physical robotics models at the Siggraph 2025 conference. The announcements include the Cosmos Reason model, a customizable 7-billion-parameter vision-language model designed for physical AI, and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU. The Cosmos Reason model allows vision agents and robots to reason like humans, using prior knowledge and common sense to make decisions. Nvidia's research papers also focus on developing more accurate 3D environments, helping innovators train advanced physical AI systems. The company's Omniverse libraries have been updated with new features, including NuRec 3D Gaussian splatting libraries for large-scale world reconstruction and updates to Nvidia's Metropolis platform for vision AI. The updates aim to create high-quality digital twins with better predictive capabilities. The RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU delivers up to 45x faster performance for workloads like video processing and AI inference, with 18x better energy efficiency compared to CPU-only systems. Early adopters include Amazon and Boston Dynamics, which are exploring the use of Omniverse and Cosmos for digital twin creation and robotics platform development.",
    "Nvidia Corporation has become the most valuable company in history, surpassing Apple's previous record. The company's market capitalization rose to $3.92 trillion on July 3, with shares increasing by 2.4% to $160.98. Nvidia's stock value has grown nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from approximately $500 billion in 2021 to nearly $4 trillion today. The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence chip technology is attributed to its newest processors, which have made significant gains in training the largest AI models. As a result, Nvidia has surpassed the combined worth of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom and the total value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets combined."
